            Foxes are mammalian and omnivorous animals belonging to the Canidae family. They are medium-sized vulpids,
            characterized by a long snout and a long, hairy tail.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also have their oval pupils, which are similar to the felids' vertical pupils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of about 40 species recognized as foxes, only 12 belong to the Vulpes genus of "true foxes", of which the
            red
            fox is the most common.
